- This is the implementation of [AAAI2018. GraphGAN](https://hwwang55.github.io/files/2018-AAAI-GraphGAN.pdf)

#### code structure

- data : includes the graph file
- pre_train : includes the pre_train embeddings file that generated by other methods, such as deepwalk, SDNE, LINE, since gan is difficult to be trained. 
- results : includes the evaluation results, you can see the results improving with the training progressing.
- src : includes the source codes

####requirements:

- tensorflow
- tqdm(display the running progress)



#### Run

```python graph_gan.py```
